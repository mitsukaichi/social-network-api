This project was done as part of the assignments in the UC Berkeley full stuck web developer coding bootcamp. In this assignment, the students are tasked to build an API that meets the following requirements from scratch:

```md
- Command line propompt to start the local server with the Mongoose models and the MongoDB database
- You can create, update, and delete users and thoughts in the database
- You can create and delete reactions to thoughts and add and remove friends to a userâ€™s friend list
```

### Things I learnt from this challenge

- Overview of the MongoDB CRUD operations - how this is different from MySQL / Sqeualize
- Overview of the model creation with mongoose - some additional features only available through mongoose
- It's sometimes confusing to understand which functionalities are coming from either MongoDB or mongoose. You may need to double check which documentation you need to refer to debug some errors
- I kept getting the error of "module not found" error as I needed to specify the filepath as '../../models' from the file in routes > api. I need a better understanding of how exactly those filepath specifications work.
- Difference between res.json vs res.send vs res.end in Express.js (from the referenced article listed above)
